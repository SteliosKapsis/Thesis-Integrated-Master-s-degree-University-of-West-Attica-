The field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning has witnessed significant progress in recent years, enabling the creation of diverse applications that enhance user experience in various fields. 
Real-time gesture recognition is one of such applications, developed within the confines of this thesis. This application has the potential to bridge communication barriers and augment reality with digital information. 
This thesis presents a comprehensive investigation into a real-time gesture recognition system. The system is designed to interpret the Greek Sign Language alphabet using static gestures, with the potential for expansion 
to include additional gestures in future training. There are no subjective evaluations included, and technical term abbreviations are explained upon first use. The language is clear and concise, using high-level, standard 
language with consistent technical terms in a formal register. The structure is logical, with causal connections between statements and a balanced perspective. Precise subject-specific vocabulary is used for greater accuracy, 
and the text is free from grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and punctuation errors. The formatting aligns with common academic sections, follows a consistent citation and footnote style, clearly marks quotes, and avoids filler words.
The first chapter sets out to analyze the significance of recognizing gestures. It highlights the objective of rectifying the issue of Greek Sign Language interpretation and deliberates several resolutions to this predicament. 
Chapter two is dedicated to the technical basis of the tools implicated in this system's execution. Furthermore, the text provides a thorough review of relevant theoretical and practical studies, allowing for a comprehensive understanding 
of basic principles and exemplified applications that have already been implemented. The third chapter details the chosen application development methodology, Rational Unified Process (RUP), presenting and analyzing all four phases. 
This analysis is further supported by use case diagrams and Gantt charts, offering an all-encompassing view of the development process. The fourth chapter presents an analysis of the application's architecture. 
The application's core is made up of four main files written in the Python programming language. These files are thoroughly examined, describing their functions and interactions with each other. The readers are provided with an in-depth 
'explanation of the system's internal workings, allowing for comprehensive comprehension. The fifth chapter explains and evaluates the confusion matrix resulting from the training of a machine learning model for multi-gesture classification. 
Abbreviations are defined when first used. Clear structure and progression with causal relationships between statements are maintained. This matrix, based on performance metrics, measures the degree to which the model recognizes 
Greek Sign Language gestures. The language is formal and objective, avoiding biased or figurative language. The final chapter of this thesis provides an objective overview of the integration and use of the gesture recognition system, drawing conclusions 
from the 13 findings. Additionally, potential avenues for future development and improvement are discussed. The chapter follows a logical progression and maintains a formal, balanced tone throughout. Technical terms are explained where necessary, 
and the language is free from grammatical errors, colloquialisms, and filler words. In summary, this thesis presents the development of a gesture recognition system for the Greek Sign Language. The ΑPI of Media Pipe-Hands was utilized to 
detect the reference points of the palm, and a data collection and pre-processing process was implemented. After training and applying a neural network, the system is able to perform real-time recognition of the specific gestures mentioned above. 
In addition to interpreting the alphabet of Greek Sign Language, this system also allows for further support of the mentioned gestures. This project contributes to the development of Computer Vision and Machine Learning applications through theoretical 
study, methodical development, creation of a flexible architecture, and integrated evaluation. It lays sturdy groundwork for enhanced communication between the deaf/hard of hearing community and others, and it elevates interactions with computers, 
all while avoiding the need for cutting-edge computing hardware.
